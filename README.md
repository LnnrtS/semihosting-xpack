## Developer info

This section is intended to developers who plan to include this library in their own projects.

### Easy install

This package can be installed from the `npm` [registry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@micro-os-plus/semihosting).

```console
$ xpm install @micro-os-plus/semihosting
```

This package is also available from [GitHub](https://github.com/micro-os-plus/semihosting-xpack):

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/micro-os-plus/semihosting-xpack.git semihosting-xpack.git
```

### Implementation

The architecture should provide a header file with the implementation for the following basic function.

```c
  static inline int
  __attribute__ ((always_inline))
  os_semihosting_call_host (int reason, void* arg);
```

### Prerequisites

Installing from `npm` registry requires a recent [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (>7.x; the 6.x LTS version is not compatible), and the `xpm` tool (https://www.npmjs.com/package/xpm).

```console
$ sudo npm install xpm --global
```

On Windows, global packages are installed in the user home folder, and do not require `sudo`.

Compiling the source code require a modern C++ compiler, preferably GCC 5 or higher, but was also compiled with GCC 4.8.
